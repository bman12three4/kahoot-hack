##What it do?
What this does is scan through all of the possible kahoot pins and see which ones are active. It prints all of them out in a console window.

Also please note that becasue this is written in python, it is really slow.
##Install
* You must have Python3 installed
* download or clone this 

##Running
* go into the directory and run play.py
* you should be able to double click it, but if not then use python play.py in the console to start it
* It gives out a list of pins which have recently been used


##WARNING
The pins given out by this program are pins that have recently been used. I do not know how long recently is, and so some of the pins given out will not work.
I believe this is due to pins still being active after a game has ended, so only about 1 in 10 pins generated work. 
I will be working on this so I will let you know when this is solved.
I have not figured out how to solve this problem yet, so any help would
